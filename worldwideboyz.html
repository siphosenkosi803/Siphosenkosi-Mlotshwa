                    In a world dominated by clean aesthetics and algorithmically curated culture, @cosmicweb_is_mine is building a different kind of universe — one woven from the threads of street culture, glitchy digital chaos, music, and ancestral energy. Raised on technology, videogames, and the wisdom of a Yuta grandmother, his work exists at the strange intersection of sci-fi dystopias and inner human potential. In this intimate, unfiltered interview, @cosmicweb_is_mine invites us into his world — where conspiracies, symbolism, and rebellion fuse into one endlessly mutating creative signal. From the cosmic web to the streets of Japan, this is a story about breaking systems, blurring boundaries, and reclaiming authorship of the narrative. Welcome to the cosmic web.
                </p>

                <h3>THE INTERVIEW:</h3>
                
                <p class="interview-question">Your work feels like a collision of streetwear, glitch art, and cyberpunk, but there's also something uniquely Japanese in its DNA. How do these worlds collide inside your head — and what draws you to this intersection?</p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: Maybe it's because I've always been drawn to cutting-edge technology and virtual worlds since I was a kid. Even in games and music videos, I often find myself captivated by CG and digital effects. I wouldn't say I'm strictly focused on streetwear — I actually want to explore a broader range of creative expressions.</p>
                
                <p class="interview-question">You blend fashion and music like they belong to the same organism. Are they equal parts of your identity, or is one secretly a portal for the other?</p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: I think I just enjoy finding connections between things that seem unrelated — like lyrics, music, visuals, or even real-life events. I often imagine colors and shapes when I listen to music, and at the same time, I like thinking about what kind of sound would match a certain graphic. For example, I feel like a "typhoon" and a "trend" are actually similar — they start locally, move unpredictably, and eventually disappear. That kind of hidden parallel fascinates me. So maybe that's why I blend music and fashion as if they're part of the same flow.</p>
                
                <p class="interview-question">If WORLD WIDE BOYZ was a movie, what would it look like? A dystopian sci-fi, a vaporwave dream, a Tokyo alleyway at 2AM?</p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: If WORLD WIDE BOYZ were a movie, it would probably start with an ordinary day in the real world — but underneath, there's a massive, hidden conspiracy involving religion and science, humans and aliens, angels and demons. It would be a raw, hyperreal sci-fi filled with symbolism and layers. On the surface, it might look like a dystopia. But at its core, it's about something deeper: a reminder that in today's world — where money, luxury, and power seem to dominate — things like warmth, connection, and inner strength matter so much more.</p>
                
                <p class="interview-question">The name cosmicweb_is_mine feels like a manifesto. Is the "cosmic web" something you believe connects creators, or is it your personal rebellion against the system?</p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: The cosmic web is a structure that connects galaxies in the universe — but if you look up images of it, you'll notice it looks strikingly similar to the structure of neural networks in the human brain. That resemblance made me wonder: what if the universe and our minds are somehow connected? "cosmicweb_is_mine" is my way of saying, this universe belongs to me. But it's not a selfish declaration — it's an invitation for everyone to feel that they are the main character of this universe. If each person believed that the world was theirs, maybe the world would become a more meaningful and empowered place. It's kind of like The Matrix, in a way.</p>
            
                <p class="interview-question">Mystery and coded symbolism seem important in your visuals. Do you want people to decode what you’re doing, or is it more about creating an emotion they can’t explain?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: Honestly, it’s both. I do want to give people a bit of a hint — some clues to guide them — but I don’t want to explain everything from A to Z. If there’s no room left to imagine or interpret, it’s not as interesting.
                    That said, this approach is mostly for what I put out on social media. In private, I actually love talking deeply about all kinds of things.
                    I also hope that my work might attract others with a similar way of thinking — like a signal for kindred spirits.
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">Your designs feel like organized chaos — raw, glitchy, but intentional. How do you navigate between control and disorder when you create?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: I think a lot of it comes from spontaneous bursts of inspiration. I prefer creating with a fresh mindset, right in the moment when the idea hits me.
                    But with WORLD WIDE BOYZ, there’s a broader vision behind it — so it makes sense if people feel there’s a calculated intention in the chaos
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">Japanese street culture has always thrived underground, away from the mainstream spotlight. What’s one thing about this subculture outsiders never get to see or understand?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: I wouldn’t say I can speak for street culture itself, but from what I observe, I think it’s fueled by the “otaku spirit.” The underground scene has always been supported by the otaku community.
                    For example, people who grew up with Vocaloid culture, like Hatsune Miku, are now thriving in Japan’s music industry. About 15 years ago, just listening to Vocaloid music was considered “uncool” in the real world. But now, producers who started with Vocaloid, like Kenshi Yonezu and YOASOBI, are leading the Japanese music scene, and that’s pretty exciting.
                    Also, in Japan, entertainment rooted in the online world, like singing streamers and VTubers, has really developed. I’m really looking forward to how online entertainment will evolve in the future, both as a creator and as a fan.
                    Sorry if I went off track there!
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">Tokyo’s creative underground is famous for blurring lines between fashion, music, and digital art. What’s your experience of being part of that — or pushing against it?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: Honestly, I don’t really know much about Tokyo’s underground scene.
                    But Tokyo itself is a chaotic mix of so many different people and energies — so it makes sense that boundaries are constantly being broken and new things are born all the time.
                    As for me, I’m more focused on understanding what it means to be human, and exploring how we can tap into our potential. I want to create work from different angles that helps unlock that deeper part of ourselves.
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">.Are you consciously breaking rules when you create, or is rebellion just naturally wired into what you do?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: Breaking rules feels good.
                    More than anything, I just want to break free from anything that feels like a cage or limitation. It’s not about rebelling for the sake of it — it’s about escaping whatever tries to trap me.
                    
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">Do you see your designs as a reflection of this world, or glimpses into a better, stranger, future world you’re building?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: I see my work as a kind of reflection of this world — almost like satire.
                    At the same time, I like to imagine an optimistic future. But if we’re heading toward a darker one, then I want my art and mindset to act as something that can help shift that trajectory.
                    It’s about showing both what is, and what could be — and offering a push toward the better path.
                    
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">You have this recurring visual language — symbols, colors, chaos. What’s the one motif or theme that keeps haunting your work?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: If this world is being driven by a chaotic and complex system, then I want to keep sending messages that help unravel it.
                </p>

                <p class="interview-question">Was there a specific memory, space, or person that made you realize: “Yeah — this is my world, I’m building it now”?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: My grandmother was a Yuta — a spiritual medium in Okinawa — and ever since I was little, she taught me to respect the gods and our ancestors.
                    Because of that, I probably spent more time than most people thinking about what “god” really means. I even had one mysterious experience while living with her — just once, but it was enough to convince me that there’s something real beyond what we can see.
                    Looking back now as an adult, I think that’s where everything I’m doing today really started.
                    
                     </p>

                <p class="interview-question">If you had to design something for a person feeling invisible or lost in the noise of society, what would it look like — what would it say to them without words?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: I think I’d design a perfectly structured daily routine schedule — seriously.
                    When you feel lost or overwhelmed by society, it’s easy to blame the outside world. But society has always been chaotic in every era. Whether we can handle it or not isn’t society’s fault — it’s often a reflection of our own internal state.
                    So instead of trying to fix the world, I’d start by asking: Are you sleeping well? Are you eating properly? Are you moving your body?
                    That’s why my design would quietly say: Start here. With something as simple as a daily routine.
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">Fashion and music both live publicly, but they’re deeply personal for creators. How do you protect your private self while creating for an audience?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: I think I’m pretty open — maybe even more than most people around me.
                    Sometimes I’m so open that it makes others feel uncomfortable.
                    But I’ve started to feel that the people who still stick around after seeing me like that… they’re the ones who are truly for life.
                    Of course, I’m always trying to grow, but I want to do that without pretending to be someone I’m not.
                    
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">If you woke up tomorrow and the internet was gone — what part of your creative identity would survive, and what would you gladly let vanish?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: Honestly, if the internet disappeared tomorrow, I probably wouldn’t be able to do anything.
                    Everything I create right now is through a computer and the internet — I’m not into drawing by hand, and I don’t have the motivation to learn an instrument. My creativity exists because the internet exists.
                    But I’m always optimistic.
                    If it came to that, maybe I’d just start farming — for the sake of Japan.
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">The world sees Japan’s streetwear scene as clean, curated, and iconic — but what’s the raw, unseen side of that world that you wish more people knew about?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: It’s hard for me to say, because I can only really speak from my own experience.
                    I don’t feel like I fully know the scene well enough to talk about its hidden sides — I’m just doing my thing in my own way.
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">What’s one risk you’ve taken in your work — a project or idea — that made you nervous but felt necessary?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: I’ve never really felt nervous about taking risks.
                    And even if something did make me uneasy, I’d still want to go for it — because the experience itself is valuable.
                    Worst case, I crash and burn. And honestly, I’m fine with that.
                    
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">Who are the underground designers, artists, or musicians in Tokyo you think the world should be paying attention to right now?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: They might not be considered underground anymore, but for me, it’s definitely THE MILLENNIUM PARADE.
                    I just want to dive headfirst into their world — the atmosphere, the visuals, the sound — everything about it feels like a fully formed universe.
                    </p>

                <p class="interview-question">If you could leave behind one strange object, phrase, or piece of art that represents your life’s work, what would it be?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine:  Café au lait.</p>

                <p class="interview-question">Last one — what do you hope people feel when they wear or hear something you made? Is there a word for it in Japanese, or is it something beyond language?
                </p>
                
                <p class="interview-answer">@cosmicweb_is_mine: I want them to feel like they have the power to change the world.
                    And thank you — truly — for reading this far.
