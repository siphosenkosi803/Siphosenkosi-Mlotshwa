                    Princy Mthombeni doesn't advocate for nuclear energy—she architects atomic sovereignty. Where others see uranium rods, she sees liberation vectors; where critics imagine meltdowns, she demonstrates forty years of flawless operation at Koeberg. This award-winning nuclear communicator wields facts like control rods—moderating the chain reactions of misinformation that keep 600 million Africans in darkness. Her credentials read like a fusion reactor blueprint: IAEA consultant, Stand Up For Nuclear coordinator, founder of Africa's nuclear youth movement. But peel back the titles and you'll find something more radical—a woman reprogramming energy apartheid at the neutron level, proving Africa's right to the very technology that powers Silicon Valley and European grids.</p>
                    <p>This interview isn't merely Q&A—it's a core sample drilled through layers of neo-colonial energy policy, extracting pure fissile truth. Princy speaks with the precision of a centrifuge: separating myth from isotope, rhetoric from reactor-grade reality. When she declares "electricity is freedom," she's not quoting a slogan but describing the algorithmic apartheid that keeps hospitals dark while uranium sails overseas. Note how she dismantles three fallacies per answer—about safety, about capability, about Africa's right to industrialize—each response a control rod inserted into the overheating reactor of outdated thinking. What follows isn't conversation. It's the blueprint for a continent going critical.</p>

                    <h3>THE INTERVIEW:</h3>

                    
                    
                    <p class="interview-question">You’ve called yourself an “African nuclear advocate” — not just an energy activist, but a 
voice rooted in place. What does it mean to localize a global technology like nuclear 
power within the South African story?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span> I identify as an energy activist, but my focus is on nuclear energy because it's the field I 
know best and also one of the most misunderstood. Being an “African nuclear advocate” 
means more than supporting a technology, it means grounding that support in local 
realities, histories, and ambitions. Localising a global technology like nuclear power in the 
South African context involves steering our own course in research, innovation, and 
development. We made a bold attempt with the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) 
project, which could have led us to a home-grown nuclear solution. Unfortunately, political 
dynamics cut that journey short. Still, the principle remains: any country choosing to build 
a nuclear power plant here must align with our localisation policies – requiring technology 
vendors to collaborate with South African companies. This ensures that nuclear 
development not only powers our grid but also builds our economy and expertise. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question">When you speak about nuclear energy, it’s not just technical — it feels like you’re 
defending a future. What future are you really fighting for?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>When I speak about nuclear energy, I’m not just talking about technology but I’m standing 
up for a different future. One where energy poverty no longer holds Africa back. Today, 
over 600 million Africans still live without electricity. That’s not just a statistic – it’s a crisis 
that affects every aspect of life. 
Without reliable energy, children can’t study at night, clinics can’t store life-saving 
medicine, businesses can’t scale, and women are forced to spend hours collecting 
firewood instead of pursuing opportunity. This is about dignity, development, and self
determination. 
The developed world was built on consistent, abundant power. For them, energy has 
always meant progress and independence. I’m fighting for a future where Africa claims 
that same power—literally and figuratively. A future where we are not left in the dark while 
the rest of the world moves forward in the light. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question">In a world saturated with greenwashing and half-hearted climate pledges, what does true 
energy justice look like?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span> In a world full of greenwashing and empty climate promises, true energy justice means 
giving African nations the same foundation for prosperity that the developed world enjoys: 
reliable, abundant power. It's not just about generating electricity – it’s about building the 
infrastructure for thriving industries, modern economies, and dignified lives. 
Energy is more than fuel; it’s leverage, it’s agency, it’s sovereignty. True justice means 
Africa is no longer side-lined in the global energy conversation or left in the shadows while 
others thrive in the light. It means empowering the continent to lead its own development 
on its own terms.</p>


                    <p class="interview-question">You’ve faced intense public scrutiny and political opposition. How do you hold your 
ground in a landscape where narratives are engineered and silence is rewarded? </p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>I wouldn’t say I’ve faced intense public scrutiny or political opposition. On the contrary, 
I’ve received far more support than resistance. Of course, there are a few individuals who 
disagree, but their reasons are their own. 
What has helped me hold my ground is staying rooted in facts, not politics. I speak from a 
place of evidence, not emotion. My advocacy is grounded in science – what I say is not 
just opinion, but what can be proven. In a space where narratives are often manipulated 
and silence can feel safer, I choose to speak truth with integrity. That’s how I continue to 
stand firm. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question">What’s the most misunderstood thing about nuclear energy in Africa — not just the 
science, but the story?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>One of the most misunderstood things about nuclear energy in Africa is not just the 
science, but it is the story we tell ourselves, or rather, the story told about us. There’s a 
persistent myth that we are not capable of operating nuclear power safely or effectively. 
Critics say the South African government can’t manage basic infrastructure, so how could 
it possibly handle something as complex as nuclear? 
However, that narrative ignores the reality. We have been safely operating the Koeberg 
Nuclear Power Station for 40 years. It’s not only among the safest of its kind in the world, 
but also the most reliable power station in the Eskom fleet and delivers some of the 
cheapest electricity, according to Eskom itself. 
We absolutely have the skills. In fact, over 140 South African nuclear professionals are 
currently working at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant in the UAE. Our talent is 
recognised globally, even if it's sometimes overlooked at home.  </p>


                    <p class="interview-question">Some people treat nuclear energy as a symbol of control. Others see it as liberation. 
Where do you stand in that tension?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>I see nuclear energy as a symbol of liberation. It represents the power to take control of 
our own development – clean, abundant, and sustainable energy that can fuel entire 
economies. For Africa, that means strengthening our sovereignty, unlocking prosperity, 
and positioning ourselves to compete on a global stage. 
While some view nuclear through the lens of control, I see it as the key to freedom – 
freedom from energy poverty, from dependence, and from the limitations that have held 
us back for too long. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question">How do you navigate being both a woman in STEM and a disruptor in a male-dominated 
policy space — without being reduced to either?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>I navigate it by staying true to who I am. I don’t try to be liked but I focus on being 
authentic and grounded in my purpose. I have learned not to let other people’s opinions 
define me or distract me. 
Being a woman in STEM and a disruptor in a male-dominated policy space comes with 
challenges, but I’ve also come to understand something important: patriarchy isn’t upheld 
by men alone, sometimes it’s reinforced by women too. But even in the noise, there are 
always those – both men and women – who see me, support me, and have helped shape 
the woman I am today. I choose to focus on that and to keep showing up unapologetically. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question">If you could rewrite the African energy curriculum from scratch, what would you include 
that’s never been taught? </p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>I would start by telling the full story – one that’s often left out. I would teach that Africa is 
not just resource-rich in a general sense, but specifically holds vast reserves of strategic 
minerals like uranium, which powers nuclear energy around the world. 
I would also include a critical lens on the global climate change agenda – highlighting how 
the politics behind it often are not neutral. Too often, climate policy becomes a backdoor 
tool used to keep underdeveloped nations locked in cycles of dependence and poverty, 
restricting their path to industrialisation. 
We need a curriculum that empowers Africans with truth, context and the confidence to 
define our own energy future. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question">What role does mythology play in shaping public fear around nuclear tech — and how do 
you counter myth with truth?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>Mythology plays a powerful role in shaping public fear around nuclear energy – often 
cloaked in moral or even spiritual arguments. People are told that only renewable energy 
sources are “God-given,” and that embracing nuclear is somehow unethical or unnatural. 
These narratives may sound righteous, but they overlook the real human cost of energy 
poverty. 
The truth is; morality loses its meaning when it denies people access to opportunity, 
health, and dignity. What is ethical about leaving millions without electricity? What is just 
about holding back progress for the sake of ideology? 
I counter myth with facts but also with empathy. Because this conversation is not just 
about watts and reactors. It is about lives. It is about empowering people with the full truth, 
so we can make choices that are both just and informed. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> You’ve said that energy is a human right. In that case, what would it mean to reframe 
electricity not as a utility, but as a form of freedom? </p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>Yes energy is a human right and that makes electricity more than just a utility – it’s 
freedom. It enables education, healthcare, business and dignity. Reframing it this way 
means recognising electricity as essential to opportunity and development, not a luxury. It 
is a catalyst for empowering people and unlocking Africa’s full potential. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> If a young girl in a rural village discovered your work online, what do you hope she feels 
before she even understands the science? </p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>I hope she sees a reflection of herself – someone who looks like her, comes from a place 
like hers and feels an immediate sense of belonging. Even before she understands the 
science, I want her to feel seen, inspired and reminded that she doesn’t have to wait to be 
perfect or have all the answers to start dreaming big.  
I hope it quiets any imposter syndrome and plants the seed that she, too, can contribute 
to shaping the world. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> What’s your relationship with the word “power” — not just electrical, but political, personal, 
symbolic? </p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span> To me, power is the ability to create change. It’s about agency – personally, politically and 
symbolically. It means having the strength to speak up, take action and reclaim space, 
especially as an African woman. True power is possibility in motion. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> As someone shaping the future of the continent, how do you avoid being co-opted by old 
systems dressed in new buzzwords?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>I avoid being co-opted by questioning who truly benefits from new ideas. I look beyond 
buzzwords and stay grounded in Africa’s realities, committed to solutions that serve our 
people – not recycled systems in disguise. Real change means building frameworks that 
reflect our own vision and values. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> You’re not just promoting a technology — you’re rewriting a narrative. How do you resist 
becoming a “brand” in the age of performative activism?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>I  don’t resist becoming a brand because I already am one. When people talk about 
nuclear energy in Africa and my name comes to mind, that’s what a brand means to me: 
recognition rooted in credibility and purpose. 
But I’m not here for performance – I’m here for impact. I respect both the truth and my 
audience, and I never compromise on facts. My work is grounded in evidence, not trends, 
and I let the integrity of that work speak louder than any label. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> What part of yourself do you protect the most — and what part do you intentionally leave 
raw, visible, unpolished?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>The part of myself I protect the most is my inner peace – my sense of clarity and purpose. 
In a world full of noise, criticism and distractions, I guard the space that keeps me 
grounded and aligned with why I do this work. 
However, the part I intentionally leave raw and visible is my passion. I don’t hide how 
deeply I care about Africa’s future or how emotional I can get when talking about energy 
justice. I believe there is strength in being unpolished – because it reminds people that I’m 
not a symbol, I’m a human being fighting for something real. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> If the current global energy system were a crumbling empire, what role would Africa play 
in the rewrite? </p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>If the current global energy system were a crumbling empire, Africa has the potential to 
play a much more powerful role than it currently does. Right now, given our energy 
challenges, we are often cast in a servant role – supplying resources but not fully 
benefiting from them. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> What’s one moment in your advocacy journey that nearly broke you — and what rebuilt 
you after that?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>One of the toughest moments in my advocacy journey was when my own employer turned 
against me, trying everything to silence me and stop my nuclear advocacy. I can handle 
opposition from outsiders, but it hurts deeply when those you expect to support you 
instead use their power to hold you down. 
What rebuilt me was the incredible support that came from my colleagues and people 
outside my immediate circle – those who stood by me, lifted me up, and reminded me why 
my voice matters. Their solidarity gave me the strength to keep going. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> If we fast forward 50 years, what signal do you hope is still echoing from the work you’ve 
done today?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>I hope the signal echoing from my work is clear: that energy poverty has become a thing 
of the past – something people only read about in history books. Where everyone enjoys 
a better quality of life, powered by reliable, clean and accessible energy that fuels 
opportunity and dignity across Africa. </p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> We often speak of light as metaphor — but in your work, literal light (electricity) is 
metaphor. What does it illuminate about the world we’re building?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span> Yes, in my work, literal light (electricity) is more than just power. It is a powerful metaphor 
for possibility and progress. It illuminates the path toward a world where every African has 
the chance to thrive, learn and contribute. This light reveals our potential to overcome 
darkness – not just the absence of electricity, but also the absence of opportunity, equality 
and hope. The world we’re building is one where energy lights up more than homes. It lights up 
futures, freedoms and dreams. It shows a vision of Africa stepping confidently into its own 
power and leading on its own terms.</p>


                    <p class="interview-question"> Last transmission: What’s the message you’d leave behind for the next generation of 
African energy visionaries — the ones who will take this torch and run beyond what we’ve 
even dared to imagine?</p>
                
                    <p class="interview-answer"><span class="interview-handle">@princymthombeni:</span>To the next generation of energy leaders: own your power and never be afraid to dream 
bigger than anyone else thinks you should. Africa doesn’t need permission but we need 
respect and true partnerships that let us decide our path. 
Nuclear energy is more than a tool. It is a chance to bring justice and dignity to millions. It 
shows what happens when Africa takes charge of its future. So take the torch and run. 
The possibilities are endless. </p>

                                <p>Princy Mthombeni’s voice doesn’t fade—it achieves critical mass. Every answer here fissures the old narrative of African energy dependence, splitting atoms of doubt into pure kinetic conviction. She’s shown us the blueprint: not reactors as hand-me-downs from the Global North, but as sovereign infrastructure forged in African research labs and staffed by homegrown engineers. The interview may end, but the chain reaction has just begun—in every rural school that could run night classes, every clinic that could refrigerate vaccines, every young girl who now sees uranium as liberation ore. This is the ultimate decay curve: the half-life of energy apartheid measured in years, not millennia. Princy’s work ticks louder by the second.</p>
